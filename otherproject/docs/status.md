## Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Database Technology Selection
**Date**: 2024-01-10
**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**: Use SQLite for both development and production
**Context**: Need for simple, reliable database without external dependencies
**Consequences**: 
- ‚úÖ Zero configuration deployment
- ‚úÖ Excellent performance for single-node applications
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited concurrent write scalability
- üìã PostgreSQL migration path maintained for future scaling

### ADR-002: Authentication Strategy
**Date**: 2024-01-12
**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**: Session-based authentication with streamlit-authenticator
**Context**: Need for secure, stateful authentication in Streamlit environment
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Secure session management
- ‚úÖ Integration with Streamlit state
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires sticky sessions in load-balanced environments

### ADR-003: PDF Generation Approach
**Date**: 2024-01-20
**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**: Runtime PDF generation with optional backup storage
**Context**: Security requirement for no permanent document storage
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced security (no persistent sensitive documents)
- ‚úÖ Real-time generation ensures current data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher CPU usage for repeated generations
- üìã Optional backup for internal users only

### ADR-004: External Service Integration
**Date**: 2024-01-25
**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**: Direct eSignatures.com API integration with retry logic
**Context**: Need for reliable document signing workflow
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling and retries
- ‚úÖ Real-time status updates
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- üìã Webhook implementation planned for future

### ADR-005: Testing Strategy
**Date**: 2024-02-01
**Status**: Accepted

**Decision**: Real data testing with external service mocking only
**Context**: Need for comprehensive testing without business logic mocks
**Consequences**:
- ‚úÖ Higher confidence in business logic
- ‚úÖ Realistic test scenarios
- ‚úÖ Better integration testing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex test data management
